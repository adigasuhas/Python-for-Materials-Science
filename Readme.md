   - Understanding variables and data types
   - Using loops and conditionals
   - Writing functions
   - Best Python practises

2. **Regular Expressions** (Week-2)
   - Pattern matching and text processing

3. **Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy** (Week-3)
   - Handling and analyzing structured data
   - Performing mathematical operations on arrays

4. **Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics)** (Week-4 and 5)
   - Working with crystallographic data
   - Generating and analyzing material structures

5. **Advanced Materials Science Libraries** (Week-7 and 8)
    - SMACT
    - ElementEmbeddings
    - CrystalLLM
    - SkipAtom

6. **Accessing Materials Data** (Week-9)
   - Data retrieval using API (Materials Project and Optimade)

## Note:
I will be creating and updating notebooks for each topic weekly, documenting everything I learnt as a beginner. This process will take time as I have to start making notebooks from scratch. I aim to complete all topics within 10 weeks. I expect to upload the first Notebook on 2nd week of May 2025.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the provided tutorials as a guide to enhance your knowledge in computational materials science!
