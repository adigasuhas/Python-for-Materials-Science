    "\n",
    "A **regular expression** (commonly abbreviated as *regex* or *regexp*) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern in text. It serves a similar purpose to the \"Find\" or \"Find and Replace\" functions that we often use in word processors, PDF readers, or other software tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of regular expressions was introduced in the 1950s by American mathematician **Stephen Cole Kleene**, and it was first implemented in Unix-based text-processing utilities.\n",

    "## üìÑ Relevance in Materials Science\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of materials science, regular expressions can be particularly useful when working with text files that contain repeated patterns. For example, they can help extract chemical compositions or other structured information from raw data files. This becomes especially important in the application of machine learning to materials science, where preprocessing and extracting relevant information from text is a key step in building accurate models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Metacharacters are symbols used in regex to define search patterns more precisely. Below is a table summarizing commonly used metacharacters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Character(s) | Function | Example |\n",
    "|--------------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| `[]`         | Identifies a set or range of characters | `[u-w]` matches any one character in the range *u* to *w*. |\n",
    "| `()`         | Captures and groups characters | `(u-w)` groups characters literally, not as a range. |\n",
    "| `\\`          | Indicates a special sequence | `\\s` matches any whitespace character. |\n",
    "| `.`          | Matches any single character (except newline) | `d..d` matches any 4-letter word that starts and ends with `d`, like `dead` or `died`. |\n",
    "| `^`          | Asserts the start of a string | `^Na` matches strings starting with `Na`, like `NaCl` or `Nascent`. |\n",
    "| `$`          | Asserts the end of a string | `.$` matches strings ending with any single character followed by a period. |\n",
    "| `*`          | Matches zero or more occurrences | `Na.*C` matches strings where `Na` is followed by any characters (including none) and then a `C`. |\n",
    "| `+`          | Matches one or more occurrences | Similar to `*`, but requires at least one occurrence. |\n",
    "| `?`          | Matches zero or one occurrence | Useful for optional characters or groups. |\n",
    "| `{n}`        | Matches exactly *n* occurrences | `Na.{2}Cl` matches `Na` followed by any 2 characters, and then `Cl`. |\n",
    "| `|`          | Logical OR (either this or that) | `metal|non-metal` matches either `metal` or `non-metal`. |\n",

    "| `\\B`         | Matches where `\\b` does **not** match, i.e., **not** at the beginning or end of a word | Useful for identifying substrings inside a word, like `r\"\\BCl\"` in `NaCl`. |\n",
    "| `\\d`         | Matches **any digit** (equivalent to `[0-9]`) | In `Na0.5Cl0.5`, using `\\d+` would return `['0', '5', '0', '5']`. |\n",
    "| `\\D`         | Matches **any non-digit character** | In `NaCl`, `\\D` would return `['N', 'a', 'C', 'l']`. |\n",
    "| `\\s`         | Matches any **whitespace** character (spaces, tabs, newlines) | In `'Ti O2'`, `\\s` would match the space between `Ti` and `O2`. |\n",
    "| `\\S`         | Matches any **non-whitespace** character | In `'Ti O2'`, `\\S` would match `['T', 'i', 'O', '2']`. |\n",
    "| `\\w`         | Matches any **word character** (letters, digits, or underscore) | In `BaTi_O3`, `\\w` matches all characters. |\n",
    "| `\\W`         | Matches any **non-word character** | In `BaTi_O3!`, `\\W` matches only the `!`. |\n",
    "| `\\Z`         | Matches if the specified characters are at the **end** of the string | `O3\\Z` matches only if the string ends with `O3`. |\n",
